	<h1>Color Wars game</h1>
	<p>
		Based on the popular Color Game (vÃ¤ripeli) where the players try to get more areas than their opponent by
		converting different color areas into their own colors.
		This game has the added mechanics of real-time gameplay, fog of war, convertion speed 
		(colors that have largely different RGB values are take longer to convert) and themed visualizations.
		The player starts with a (somewhat) random color and tile from which he must click other tiles adjacent to his own tiles to convert these tiles.
		There is also an opponent (AI, presented as ">:("-mark) that tries to convert as many tiles as possible.
		The goal is to convert more tiles than the opponent.
